Module 7

3.4 Rational Fx

// Rational number is quotient of 2 integers
// Rational function is quotient of 2 polynomials

f(x) = p(x)/q(x)
where: q(x) != 0

Ex: 

h(x) = ( x^2 - 3 ) / ( 2x^4 + 9x^2 + 7 )
Domain: all real numbers (denom can never = 0)

g(x) = 5/x
Domain: all nonzero real numbers

if numerator and denomincator of a rational Fx have common factors, we cancel these factors in a simpler form.

Ex: 

f(x) = ( x^3 - x^2 + 7x - 7 ) / ( x^2 + 7x - 8 )
factor:
f(x) = ( x-1 )( x^2 + 7 ) / ( x-1 )( x+8 )

simplify (cancel)
f(x) = ( x^2 + 7 ) / ( x+8 )
x cannot = -8
x = 1 is excluded from domain befause x=1 was undefined in origional form (before simplifying) 
// in graph, there's a hole @ (1, 8/9)

f(x) will approach 8/9 as x approaches 1
in desmos, you will only see this upon close examination

asymptote = line graph approaches but never touches
